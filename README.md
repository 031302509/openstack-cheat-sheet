## handy scripts

### Check Openstack Services

```bash
for service in `systemctl list-units | grep -P "(openstack)|(neutron)"| sed 's/●//g' | awk  '{print $1}'`; do
        if systemctl is-active $service &>/dev/null; then
                echo -e "\e[32m$service is OK!\e[0m"
        else
                echo -e "\e[31m$service fail to start!\e[0m"
        fi
done
```

## keystore

## glance

* [images registry](http://apps.openstack.org/#tab=glance-images): Download images, like `Ubuntu`, `CentOS`,`Sahara Apache Spark 1.0.0`,etc.


Upload image uses glance may be very slow as using http transmission. If use ceph rbd backend storage, we can speed up via rbd import command:

```bash
upload()
{
        IMAGE_PATH=$1 # get image path
        if [[ -z $IMAGE_PATH ]]; then
                echo "Usage: $0 <IMAGE>"
                exit 1
        fi
        IMAGE=$(basename $IMAGE_PATH) # get image file name
        SUFFIX=${IMAGE##*.} # get the format of the image
        POOL=${2:-openstack-00}
        NAME=${IMAGE%.*} # extract image name from path

        # if not raw format, we should convert it
        FORMAT=$(qemu-img info ubuntu-16.04.1-server-amd64.iso  | grep "file format" | awk '{print $3}')
        if [[ $FORMAT != raw ]]; then
                TEMP_PATH=/tmp/${IMAGE}.raw
                qemu-img convert -O raw $IMAGE_PATH $TEMP_PATH
        fi
        if [[ -n $TEMP_PATH ]]; then
                TARGET_PATH=$TEMP_PATH
        else
                TARGET_PATH=$IMAGE_PATH
        fi
        
        # get cluster id and image id  
        CLUSTER_ID=$(ceph -s 2>/dev/null | grep -w "cluster" | awk '{print $2}')
        IMAGE_ID=$(glance image-create | grep -w 'id' | awk '{print $4}')

        # import image use rbd
        rbd --pool=openstack-00 import $TARGET_PATH  --image=$IMAGE_ID --new-format --order 24
        rbd snap create $POOL/${IMAGE_ID}@snap
        rbd snap protect $POOL/${IMAGE_ID}@snap

        # update image metadata
        glance --os-image-api-version=1 image-update --is-public True --disk-format raw --container-format bare --name $NAME $IMAGE_ID
        glance --os-image-api-version=1 image-update --location rbd://$CLUSTER_ID/$POOL/$IMAGE_ID/snap $IMAGE_ID

        # remove temp file if exists
        if [[ -n $TEMP_PATH ]]; then
                rm $TEMP_PATH
        fi
}
```

## nova

### Tips

List all `error` servers:

```
nova list --status error --all-tenants
```

List all servers and their mapped host:

```
nova list --fields name,host
```

List IDs of servers:

```
nova list --minimal | tail -n +4 | head -n -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2
```

List IDs of servers with `error` status:

```
nova list --minimal --status error --all-tenants | tail -n +4 | head -n -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2
```

List all the servers whose name starts with "test":

```
nova list --name "^test"
```

Attached volumes' ID:

```
nova show --minimal 65e761b3-63b4-498f-9735-08e246c1e976 | grep 'os-extended-volumes:volumes_attached' | cut -d '|' -f 3 | jq '.[].id' | sed 's/"//g'
```

Attached volumes' ID and the mapped device name:

```
nova show --minimal | grep 'os-extended-volumes:volumes_attached' | cut -d '|' -f 3 | jq '.[]|.id + " " + .device_name' | sed 's/"//g'
```

Remove all servers (**dangrous**)

Only this tenant:

```bash
nova delete `nova list --fields id | grep -P '\w{8}-.*' | awk '{print $ 2}' | tr '\n' ' '`
```

Clean up all tenants' servers:

```bash
nova delete `nova list --all-tenants --fields id | grep -P '\w{8}-.*' | awk '{print $ 2}' | tr '\n' ' '`
```

## cinder

List ID of `error` volumes:

```
cinder list --status error --all-tenants | tail -n +4 | head -n -1 | cut -d '|' -f 2
```

List all the snapshots of the volume specified by ID:

```
cinder snapshot-list --volume-id 2ad21c7d-dbef-49a9-ba6c-64c258101eb0 | grep -P "\w{8}-\w{4}" | cut -d ' ' -f 2
```

List all the snapshots of the volume specified by name:

```
cinder list | grep "YOUR_VOLUME_NAME" | awk '{system("cinder snapshot-list --volume-id " $2)}' | grep -P "\w{8}-\w{4}" | cut -d ' ' -f 2
```

Remove all the snapshots of the volume specified by name:

```
cinder list  | grep 'YOUR_VOLUME_NAME' | awk '{system("cinder snapshot-list | grep " $2)}' | awk '{system("cinder snapshot-delete " $2)}'
```
